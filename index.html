									<h3>Databases</h3>
									<p>This course introduces students to the three cornerstone database technologies for big data, namely relational, NoSQL and Hadoop ecosystems. The course aims to give students an understanding of how data is organised and manipulated at large scale, and practical experience of the design and development of such databases using open source infrastructure.  The relational part will cover conceptual, logical and physical database design, including ER modelling and normalisation theory, as well as SQL coding and best practices for performance enhancement.  NoSQL database were developed for big data and semi-structured data applications where relational systems are too inefficient; all four types of NoSQL architecture are introduced.  Distributed data processing is key in manipulating large data sets effectively.  The final section of the course teaches the popular Hadoop technologies for distributed data processing, such as MapReduce programming and the execution model of Apache Spark.</p>

									<h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
									<p>Visualisation is the graphical representation of data with the goal of improving comprehension, communication, hypothesis generation and decision making. This course aims to teach the principles of effective visualisation of large, multidimensional data sets. This course covers the field of visual thinking, outlining current understanding of human perception and demonstrating how we can use this knowledge to create more effective data visualisations.</p>

									<h3>Perscriptive Analytics</h3>
									<p>This corse explores a number of tools and methods which support the initial phases of a process of enquiry or analysis and also contemplate the different modelling approaches to problems which are messy or ill defined. The course's interest is in understanding both the epistemological basis of different approaches as well as evaluating the extent to which they add rigour and promote insight. The course critiqued the efficacy of different approaches through a variety of readings and case studies. Topics include systems modelling and insights from complexity theory, soft systems methodology, cognitive mapping, heuristics and biases of human decision making, managing multiple criteria using value functions. The second part of the course consisted of some optimisation techniques such as linear programming, multi-objective programming,and simulation using excel</p>

									<h3>Statistical and high performace computing</h3>
									<p>This course aimed to provide student with a foundation in statical computing for data science.  The course was divided into three sections, namely basic programming, high performance computing and simulation and optimisation.  In the first section students learnt how to write computer programs to analyse data with the R Language and environment for statistical computing. Students then learnt how to run jobs in parallel on a remote computer cluster using a Linux command prompt.  Finally the course introduced students to the fundamental principles and uses of simulation and optimisation.</p>

									<h3>Dissertation</h3>
									<p>The  main  objective  I seek in my dissertaion  is  to  minimise  the  monthly  cost  of electricity  of  a  commercial  shopping  centre  by  reducing  their demand charge through peak shaving by creating an optimal control signal for a battery system. In order to achieve this objective reinforcement learning is used to maximise the demand savings derived from the battery system whilst taking into account the inherent risk introduced by the environment.</p>

							<h2>Energy Demand Profile Segmentation</h2>
							<p>As the world leverage's data across multiple industries, with great success, the
energy sector holds great potential for this application. With the recent drive
for more renewable energy resources and decreasing battery prices there
opens up room for applications such as demand management, smart-grids, peak
shaving etc. With these new resources changing our demand chain, larger power suppliers
will also need a better understanding of how their power generation would need
to be developed in order to accommodate these new demands. This project aims to gain better understanding of energy demand trends through clustering techniques.</p>

							<h2>Sustainable Fishing Simulation</h2>
							<p>Unsustainable fishing practices have been highly critised over the last few years, not only do they dimish the fish in our ocens but also the long term economic viabilty of the fishing industry. This assigment aimed to simulate how different regulations impacted the sustainability of the industry in order to help inform the decision process when implementing fishing laws</p>

							<h2>Audio Classification</h2>
							<p> The main end objective of this assignment was to create a model which could distinguish between sound waves of different instruments. The classification of audio waves is not a striaght forward task with the high dimensionality of the data. This assignment aimed to find a reduced representation of the sound waves in the frequency domain which can be given to numerous multivariate techniques. These techniques help us gain insight into the nuances between instuments and how we can use these to help classify them </p>
